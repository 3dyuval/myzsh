# asdf

[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) is a tool version manager that allows you to easily install and switch between multiple versions of programming languages and tools.

## Features

- Manage multiple runtime versions with a single CLI tool
- Use per-project language versions with `.tool-versions` file
- Easily add support for new languages via plugins
- Consistent language environment across different machines

## Setup

This is a work in progress. Future implementation will include:

- Configuration for common language plugins
- Default `.tool-versions` file
- Integration with the dotfiles installation script

## Usage

Once fully configured, asdf will automatically manage your language versions based on the `.tool-versions` file in your project, or the global configuration.
