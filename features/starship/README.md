## Enable/Disable

```zsh
# Enable Starship configuration
../../my.zsh --starship

# Disable Starship configuration
../../my.zsh  # Run without the --starship flag
```

## Implementation

The Starship configuration is stored in `starship.toml` and is automatically symlinked to `~/.config/starship.toml` by the installation script.

To use Starship with Zsh, the following is added to the `.zshrc`:
```zsh
# From /source/zshrc
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```
