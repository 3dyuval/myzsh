# bash

Common configuration files and handy scripts to use when setting up or improving a `bash` environment.

## Configuration Files

### `vimrc`

Configuration to improve the user experience of `VIM`. No fancy macros, just good highlighting and native settings along with a few `autocmd` definitions that `VIM` sometimes ships with.

### `bashrc`

Mostly a list of useful aliases to save time/typing.

### `profile`

* A better, readable command prompt
* Making sure `EDITOR` is `VIM`

## Scripts

### `setTimezone.sh`

This sets the timezone for machines with `/usr/share/zoneinfo`- and `/etc/localtime`-style timezone settings.
